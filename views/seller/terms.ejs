                    <li>Payment Process: Sellers will receive their payment from the Runway Rebels admin once the order is marked complete, meaning the buyer has received and accepted the product. Funds will only be disbursed after successful delivery and the warranty period has passed.</li>
                    <li>Bank Account Security: To ensure secure transactions, each seller’s bank account name must match the registered seller’s name on the platform. Sellers may add up to two accounts, but mismatched accounts may delay or prevent payments</li>
                    <li>Product Warranty: All products sold on Runway Rebels must include a minimum of a 3-day warranty. If no complaints are raised by the buyer within 3 days of delivery, the funds will be released to the seller.</li>
                    <li>Order Confirmation: Sellers must wait for the admin to mark an order as “Paid” before dispatching the product to the buyer. Orders sent without confirmation may not be eligible for dispute resolution.</li>
                    <li>Compliance with Policies: By listing on Runway Rebels, you agree to adhere to these policies. Breaching any terms may result in penalties or account suspension.</li>
